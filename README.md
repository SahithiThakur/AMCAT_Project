## Project Description: AMCAT Dataset EDA
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the AMCAT (Aspiring Minds Computer Adaptive Test) dataset, which contains detailed employment outcomes and academic, demographic, and skill-based information of engineering graduates. The primary objective is to identify key patterns, trends, and insights that can help understand employment outcomes, salary distributions, and factors influencing job roles for graduates in various specializations.The dataset covers the period 2007 to 2014 and includes details like the candidates' degrees, specializations, job locations, salaries, and gender.
## The project also addresses a couple of interesting questions:
1)Salary Claim Check: Can fresh Computer Science graduates working as Programmer Analysts, Software Engineers, or Hardware Engineers earn between 2.5 to 3 lakhs per year, as mentioned in a Times of India article from 2019?

2)Gender and Specialization: Does gender influence the choice of specialization (like Computer Science or Electronics)?

## What We Found:
Who Earns the Most?

--MTech/ME graduates have the highest salaries, followed by BTech, MCA, and MSc.

Does Gender Impact Salary?

--There isn’t much difference in salaries between males and females.

Most Common Job Roles:

--Software Engineer is the top job, with 13.5% of students working in this role.

Top Job Locations:

--Bangalore offers the most jobs, followed by Noida and Hyderabad.

Most Popular Specializations:

--Many students specialize in Electronics & Communication (22%), Computer Science (18.6%), and Information Technology (16.5%).

Gender Split in Jobs:

--76.1% of the employed students are male, while 23.9% are female.
## Conclusion:
The data partially supports the claim about fresh graduate salaries: some Computer Science graduates earn between 2.8 to 3.5 lakhs, but not all. Also, gender doesn’t seem to impact the choice of specialization, meaning both males and females are equally likely to pursue various fields.

This analysis helps graduates understand which degrees and cities offer better opportunities and provides employers with insights on hiring trends and workforce diversity.

Many students specialize in Electronics & Communication (22%), Computer Science (18.6%), and Information Technology (16.5%).
